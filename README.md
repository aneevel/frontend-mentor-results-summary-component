## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

There's a great amount of utility to be gained by mixing relative units and percentage units. The layout starting making more sense when I started using vh/vw as well as % to specifically create
a particular experience.

Flexbox is great, but it seems best for layouts where there's consistent spacings, like the summary section. It probably would have been best to use grid for the result section, however, because each
part of it took up a different amount of space
